-------------------------------------
24.02.2010		Version 1.2
Update to the Essential Meta Model to fix some bugs and inconsistencies in the meta model.

1. Technology Architecture Principles now have a rationale slot and this has been removed from the Technology Architecture Objective class, making it consistent with the Principles and Objectives in the other layers.

2. Business Objective to Business Capability relationship added to the Business Objective and Business Capability classes. This relationship enables the modeller to capture the objectives that are supported by a capability and vice versa.

3. Relationship between Business Processes (and Business Activities) and Business Capabilities changed from single to multiple cardinality. This enables a process (and/or an activity) to support more than one capability.

4. Update to define relationship between Information View Attributes and Information Representation Attributes has been included.

The update for ECP-3 has been added to the baseline meta model, which enables a reference to external documentation to be added to any instance of any class in the meta model.
